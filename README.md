# POWER-BI-DASHBOARD-REAL TIME PROJECT

Dear Friends,

I’m thrilled to share that I’ve created a fantastic dashboard using Power BI for my  real-time office sales report. This is my very first project in Power BI, and I’ve tailored it specifically for my work in the insurance industry.

In this project, I’ve highlighted critical insights that can help boost our business. Each executive's and team leader’s performance is showcased, making it easier to track and improve outcomes. Since this is a tele-sales center, the dashboard covers various aspects, including campaign data allocation based on tenure, targets, achievements, and more.

Key Highlights of the Dashboard:
Total Data Received: Detailed breakdown by executive, team leader, and process.
Total NOP Sales: Sales figures according to executive, team leader, and process.
Average Ticket Size (ATS): Insights by executive, team leader, and process.
Total Headcount: Number of team leaders and the overall process.
Target vs. Achievement: Performance metrics for each executive, team leader, and process.
TAT Report: Turnaround time for each team leader and executive.
Sum Insured Wise Policy Sold: Breakdown by sum insured.
Year Wise Policy Sold: 1 year, 2 years 3 years policy sold.
Conversion Rates: Conversion of each executive based on their campaign.
Team Achievement (%): Percentage achievements of teams.
Average Talk Time: Average time spent by each executive on calls.
Day Presence: Attendance tracking for executives.
Team Size: Overview of team composition.

These highlights are designed to identify areas for improvement and drive better results.

I hope you find this dashboard as valuable as I do!
